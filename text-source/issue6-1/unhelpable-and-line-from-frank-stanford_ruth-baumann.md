# Unhelpable
## Ruth Baumann

To find you I had to navigate
the seas of terror Or the seas

of nothing completed Listen
is such an odd imperative What

about look Look The days
are life-sized I’m not

afraid I can hold fire A leafhopper
gave me permission

Silver moss on all the trees
Neverending it coos Nearby a gallows

sings Everybody loves We end
up in my bed We start

# Love Poem with a Line from Frank Stanford
## Ruth Baumann

I’m not talking about bees
they shit honey But Frank

Musicality is visceral But Frank
Light doesn’t have a mind

It has muscles But Frank
I met a man He talks

the whole way into
me The safe word

is corona I offer Offer Such
a great verb It makes space

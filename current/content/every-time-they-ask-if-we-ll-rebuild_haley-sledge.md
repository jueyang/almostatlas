the muck bodied memory of a meteorologist, briny with lips of catastrophe, generates the shock of lost cattails. whole and gritty, repression, protrusion. at an uncontrolled muddy compasse of oh, bizarre swirling. oh, controlled smell. oh, hips, sand, category of encompassing taste: the whir-grit-sea the dirty-salty of cataclysmic tame

as humans, oh: destruction’s sinuous crumbling of oh, fishy oh, whirl. this fearful battering troposphere

miss bourgeois weeding her muck garden with a sailboat dangling over her head, the shreds of its sails like leaves in a warped salt-choked oak

before she comes to visit, we board our windows. we shop like starved beasts, and hoarding gallons of water, loaves of bread, we boil all the shrimp, barbecue all the meat, stuff the babies with milk, and roll the cheese into logs peppered with crushed pecans. all the family, all the neighbors, all the town meanders at a notch above normal. we laugh nervously. the old ladies finger rosaries made from rose petals, roses that grew in a garden where mary herself appeared to small french children, our ancestors, those petals picked and rolled and boiled by the delicate needle fingers of the dominican nuns who traveled great lengths to have them blessed by the pope himself. if they were wealthy enough, the women got these rosaries from italy themselves, more often than not, they bought them at the visitation monastery on spring hill avenue. there, they pray the hurricanes wouldn’t get us

fathers with huge bellies gulp beer until they slosh it on the ground or someone’s kid steals a sip. a mother or two dabbs embarrassed tears as she recalls last time last time last time last time when her husband her brother her grandbaby her daughter her friend her mother father aunt uncle cousin or dear elderly neighbor (we didn’t know she didn't have anyone) stayed too late, or couldn’t climb the stairs, or got caught in the attic screaming for jesus to please come please save her you savior as her kissing lips press the top of an attic roof her father or grandfather or his father before him sanded and painted and nailed with his own hands, she presses her kissing lips there as the water covers her face and as the rouge tide takes her as the wood is too thick the ax too heavy her arms too feeble she holds her rose rosary saying hail mary full of grace hail mary full of grace hail mary full of grace hail mary full of grace take me take me don’t let me know this end

wear your most starched shirt wear your most starched shirt wear your most starched shirt we are going to a funeral two funerals several funerals we’d go to the movies but there are no movies our grandmere told us at the same time she told us about her friend, the nun, who stayed up all night with our grandmere on bourbon street until the sun rose over the mississippi river where they ate beignets so cliche to celebrate her last night of freedom before she selected seclusion at the visitation monastery on spring hill ave where they pray that hurricanes won't get us here. grandmere’s friend the nun prays  that hurricanes won't us here and one has yet to, directly, at least since camille when almost every tree on spring hill avenue threw its spanish moss into the street. grieving, naked, and exposed, they suffer the indignity of their blown back branches, limbs stretched to breaking, languishing, and held only by the memory of their shade in the easter parade. we pick up their babies and grandbabies from the avenue, bath them in bay water by the buckets, a baptism a birthing, and gather those babies in plastic bags, bring them to the center of town to the cathedral of the immaculate conception to burn them in homage in sacrifice crying not again not again not again, but

everyone knows it’s not the eye to be scared of. on every porch in town the roof is painted blue for fashion or insects now it’s brown and green and stinks with rotting bodies and lays in the neighbor’s garden littered with children’s play things, fine china, muck
